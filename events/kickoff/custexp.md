# AMD HPC User Forum Kick Off Meeting

## Customer Experiences Presentations

### Day 1: Tuesday, September 15, 2020
#### Installation and Commissioning of the Red Raider Cluster at Texas Tech
_Alan Sill, Managing Director of the High Performance Computing Center, Texas Tech University_
Alan is the Managing Director of the High Performance Computing Center and also Adjunct Professor of Physics. He also co-directs the US National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing (CAC). He is an internationally recognized expert on large-scale advanced computing systems and software, and has played a strong role in design and creation of many scientific distributed computing, cloud and grid development projects and associated standards efforts. Dr. Sill currently serves as President of the Open Grid Forum and has been a member of the advisory boards for several international cloud and distributed computing projects.

#### Supercomputing in Frankfurt
_Volker Lindenstruth, Professor for High Performance Computer Architecture, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Frankfurt_
Dr. Lindenstruth’s research group focuses on the architecture, application and further development of high performance computing in the natural and life sciences. One example is the reading and analysis of data from experiments on large accelerator facilities, such as at CERN and GSI, or FAIR. These are distributed, typically massively parallel processor systems and clusters, which are often subject to high real-time and reliability requirements. His team investigates and develops new computer architectures and algorithms, which produce particularly energy efficient results. In the context of distributed computing, GRID technologies are used in the same way as virtualization technologies or cloud computing.

#### Preparing for the Next Great Clusters at Purdue University
_Pat Finnegan, Purdue University, Data Center Architect_
Patrick Finnegan is Purdue University’s Data Center Architect and has deployed over 20 HPC systems ranging from IBM SP2 systems to working on today’s latest clusters. He has led and supported teams at the Student Cluster Competition from its beginning, and he was a lead engineer supporting the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge.

_Alex Younts, Purdue University, Principal Research Engineer_
Alex Younts is Purdue University’s Principal Research Engineer and worked at Purdue for over 15 years starting as an undergraduate student employee. He has led HPC systems deployments as well as next generation cloud and experimental computing systems for Purdue and the national community. Today Alex focuses on bringing the next generation of computing and storage to researchers.

#### Building and Deploying Expanse at SDSC
_Christopher Irving, HPC Systems Engineer, SDSC_
Christopher Irving joined SDSC in late 2011 and has been an HPC systems engineer at SDSC for the past five years. Before joining SDSC he worked at The Scripps Research Institute as a systems administrator in the Automated Molecular Imaging group, a cryo-electron (cryoEM) microscopy laboratory, where Irving designed, built, and maintained two small HPC clusters used for cryoEM post processing. Prior to that he was with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a systems and network administrator in MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.


### Day 2: Wednesday, September 16, 2020
#### Hawk – How AMD makes HLRS fly
_Michael Resch, Director of HLRS and Professor for HPC, University of Stuttgart_
Since 2003, Prof. Michael Resch has been the Director of the High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart, home of one of the fastest civil computing systems in Europe.  He also manages the Institute of High Performance Computing. Born in Graz, Austria in 1964, Prof. Resch studied technical mathematics at the Technical University in Graz. Work for the Joanneum Research Association in Graz was followed by employment as a technical assistant and department and team head at the Computing Center of the University of Stuttgart and the High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart until 2001. In 2002, he became assistant professor at the University of Houston, Texas, USA.  Prof. Resch has received numerous awards, including the Award for High Performance Distributed Computing of the National Science Foundation, the HPC Challenge Award, and the Microsoft Early Contributor Award. He has also received honorary doctorates from the Technical University at Donezk, Ukraine and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Prof. Resch is an honorary professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

#### Deployment and Testing of HPC Software Stack on the SDSC Expanse Supercomputer
_Mahidhar Tatineni, User Services Manager, SDSC_
Mahidhar Tatineni received his M.S. & Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from UCLA. He currently leads the User Services group at SDSC. He has led the deployment and support of high performance computing and data applications software on several NSF and UC resources including Comet, and Gordon at SDSC. He has worked on many NSF funded optimization and parallelization research projects such as petascale computing for magnetosphere simulations, MPI performance tuning frameworks, hybrid programming models, topology aware communication and scheduling, big data middleware, and application performance evaluation using next generation communication mechanisms for emerging HPC systems. He is co-PI on the SDSC Comet and Expanse HPC systems projects at SDSC.

#### Exploring the Limits of Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory for Non-Covalent Interactions:  Importance of Regularization and Reference Orbitals
_Matthias Lipersberger, LBL_
Matthias Lipersberger is a graduate student at UC Berkeley in the department of chemistry (2016-now). He also has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in chemistry and Biochemistry from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (University of Munich). His research interests include energy decomposition analysis and computational catalysis.

#### AMD Powering the Latest HPC Cluster at CGG
_Riju John, Advanced Systems Group Manager, CGG_
Riju John is the manager of the Advanced Systems Group at CGG. He leads a global team responsible for developing and implementing CGG’s HPC systems optimized for their seismic imaging applications. He has over 20 years of experience in HPC for seismic imaging. He started his career as a research developer designing and optimizing seismic imaging applications on HPC systems, and later transitioned into architecting hardware better suited and cost optimized to CGG’s advanced seismic imaging algorithms.  Riju holds a master’s degree in Geophysics from Rice University in Houston, and a bachelor’s degree in Exploration Geophysics from Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, India.
